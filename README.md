# Reviewing Footballer Data - Machine Learning, Inferential Statistics

## Overview 

For my R project, I decided to look at shooting-related statistics for Premier League players this season, implementing data cleaning, feature engineering, descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, visualisations and machine learning. I got this dataset from Kaggle '(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/efaniorimutembo/epl-player-shooting-stats-23-24-premier-league)'.

## Repository Contents
